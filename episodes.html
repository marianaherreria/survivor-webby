            <p>WELCOME! To Survivor: Frostbite üßä we'll kick off with a nice introduction to our 3 tribes: the crimson
                SNOWFLAKES (babila, alex b., zoya, liz, aman, dylan, sri), the lilac AURORAS (alex a., revant, 
                morgan, janae, hillary, varun, javi) and the amber ICEBERGS (riley, mytili, levi, ira, catherine, nhi & reece). 
                the colors mean absolutely nothing, and these baddies have no what icy icy things lie ahead üåÄ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è
            </p>

            <p>epi two!! for our first challenge we selected a survivor classic: F0R TH3 GR4M. the SNOWFLAKES
                 lose in a DAZZLING fashion w 9:32pm tie-breaker. catherine begins her trend of missing in action, and
                the very first vote deems AMAN the first castaway voted out of the island in a devastating 5-2 vote (with zoya and aman casting
                votes against babs). zoya has now found herself on the outs. question on everyone's minds..... WILL SHE PULL THROUGH? </p>

            <p>numero tres !!! the tide turns against levi's dashing personality, and flakies WIN "eyes for some eyes"
                 with a DUNK from Sri who couldn‚Äôt really play but snatched the very last one before the other tribes finished</p>

            <p>Epi 4: We enter on a lone Zoya struggling to survive in her tribe, while unbeknownst to her, Alex B. is shifting his aim to 
                another target... Babila üò≥. While Ira, Hillary, and Alex A. scramble with key allies voted out, the power trio of Nhi,
                Zoya, and Morgan are identifying "The Core Six". In "The Silver Screen" challenge, Icebergs lose yet ANOTHER challenge due to Catherine being MIA, while Aurora 
                loses by virtue of being bad. Knowing she's on the ropes, Ira plays her immunity idol on herself in a STUNNING MOVE to send dear Catherine home. In the Aurora tribe, Janae 
                admirably abstains while the tribe blindsides Javier, leaving Varun on the chopping block.

            <p>We begin Episode 5 with Babs, Ira, and Varun onen vote away from being voted off of the island. However, lady luck SMILES upon them, as they have made it to TRIBE SWAP!
                We end up with two new tribes:
            </p>
            <p>First, a New Iceberg tribe of Nhi, Mytili, Riley, Alex A., Hillary, Zoya, Babs, and Alex B.</p>
            <p>Second, a New Aurora tribe of Dylan, Sri, Liz, Varun, Morgan, Janae, Ira, and Reece.</p>
            <p>The challenge is "Thinking outside the Box", and it was a predictable pattern of inexperienced players choosing team-based rewards while the pros gobbled up advantages for themselves.
                New Iceberg tribe loses the challenge, and Babila is voted out after exposing just a littttttle too much of his snakiness.
            </p>

            <h2>Episode 6</h2>

                allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>After the box challenge, Aurora tribe falls into a frenzy worrying about who has what advantages. Dylan CLAIMS that HE chose the extra vote (a lie) to scare away any opposition as he targets Morgan.
                During the "Finding Frosty" challenge, Iceberg tribe WHUPS Aurora with a stunning showcase of scavenger hunt savvy. In tribal, everyone votes against themselves except for Riley, Liz, and Morgan. 
            While Liz votes for Riley in a bold but ultimately futile move, Riley and Morgan use their votes AND extra votes to make sure that Sri is extra-gone. In the process, Morgan gets spooked and plays an idol on herself. Oops! </p>

            <h2>Episode 7</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AredltxAf0Y" frameborder="0"

                allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>We begin Epi 7 with both Ira and Riley in the hotseat, one for being the only member of her tribe without an alliance and one for burning all of her advantages.
                This status is confirmed when they are voted out of their tribes in the "Left Out in the Cold" challenge, sending them each to the opposite side. The challenge, "Escaping the Ice Biome", sees interesting play from both sides, 
                as both Nhi and Zoya try to throw the challenge to keep Morgan safe. However, it turns out that she needs no help, as Aurora is carried to victory by Morgan's unforseen Morse code skills (???) and Dylan's THC-inspired guesswork.
                Ira sums it up well: "That's tough, Iceberg". In the Iceberg vote, the Nhi/Alex B./Zoya power trio decides to vote out Hillary, leaving Alex A. ally-less and surely doomed.

            </p>
