            <p>WELCOME! To Survivor: Frostbite üßä we'll kick off with a nice introduction to our 3 tribes: the crimson
                SNOWFLAKES (babila, alex b., zoya, liz, aman, dylan, sri), the lilac AURORAS (alex a., revant, 
                morgan, janae, hillary, varun, javi) and the amber ICEBERGS (riley, mytili, levi, ira, catherine, nhi & reece). 
                the colors mean absolutely nothing, and these baddies have no what icy icy things lie ahead üåÄ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è

            <p>epi two!! for our first challenge we selected a survivor classic: F0R TH3 GR4M. the SNOWFLAKES
                 lose in a DAZZLING fashion w 9:32pm tie-breaker. catherine begins her trend of missing in action, and
                the very first vote deems AMAN the first castaway voted out of the island in a devastating 5-2 vote (with zoya and aman casting
                votes against babs). zoya has now found herself on the outs. question on everyone's minds..... WILL SHE PULL THROUGH? </p>

            <p>numero tres !!! the tide turns against levi's dashing personality, and flakies WIN "eyes for some eyes"
                 with a DUNK from Sri who couldn‚Äôt really play but snatched the very last one before the other tribes finished. since we warned 
                the players of a double tribal, the bergies and auroras were launched into a killing spree. in aurora, Morgan/Janae/Varun/Javi vote
                revant in a SHOCKING and FLASHY blindside, and Revant implies that he had an idol when getting voted out, putting hillary and alex a on the outs. at The Iceberg, levi pushes
                to vote out catherine for her Continued Lack of Presence, but Nhi/Riley/Mytili/Reece end up choosing Levi bc he‚Äôs dangerous/well-connected, 
                putting ira on the outs.

            <p>epi wepi numero dies !!!!!!!!!! featuring a SPICY twist: temporary tribes. the sexy Collins tribe featured Nhi, Mytili, Alex, Varun, and Riley.
                the Meyer counterpart was composed of Morgan, Zoya, Janae, Levi, and Ira. our challenge, "We‚Äôre YA Love Triangle Stans", featured some good ole survivor
                puzzles and granted both alex and levi immunity once more (ahem..... challenge beasts?). collins executed a DAZZLING 3-2 BLINDSIDE on Mytili which
                put riley on the outs, and meyer just had... a lot. (1) Morgan has to vote against herself, Levi and Ira vote against her. (2) Zoya uses extra vote on Ira, Janae votes her as well
                (3) In revote, 2-1 against Ira (4) Levi on the outs (as usual) stay tooned for more! (jk)
